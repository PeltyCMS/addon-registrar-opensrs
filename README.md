# OpenSRS

Register and renew domains with OpenSRS

Official **domain registrar** for [PeltyCMS](https://github.com/MythicalLTD/PeltyCMS) — identifier `registrar-opensrs`.

## Why this addon

Resellers who sell domains next to hosting and need automated register / renew.

## Features

- Availability checks against the official **OpenSRS** API
- Register, renew and transfer domains from Pelty orders
- Nameserver and contact updates where the API allows
- TLD costs sync into Pelty pricing
- Sandboxed WASM registrar — credentials stay in the panel

## How it works

1. Install **OpenSRS** from the [Mythical marketplace](https://market.mythicalsystems.org/marketplace/product/registrar-opensrs) (or Pelty Admin → Addons → Marketplace).
2. Open Pelty Admin and enter your OpenSRS credentials in the addon settings.
3. Attach it to the products / forms / login flows you care about.
4. New orders and sign-ins use OpenSRS automatically.

## Requirements

- A running PeltyCMS panel with WASM addons enabled
- Valid OpenSRS API / OAuth / panel credentials (depending on the integration)
- Outbound HTTPS from the panel to OpenSRS
